AOE 2 Key-to-button mapping
by Kris Scott

Playing on a laptop touchpad is hard enough without having to move the pointer
to the lower right hand of the screen in order to start researching. This
script listens for the 5x3 grid of keys (from Q to B) and sends a click to the
button corresponding to its distance from the origin (Key Q => Top Left Button)

Your resolution may differ: To reset origin location, hit Shift+CapsLock while
hovering over the center of the top-left button. This location will be saved
in the same directory as the script, and used next time it's run.

I may add some additional convenience bindings later, check the script itself.
